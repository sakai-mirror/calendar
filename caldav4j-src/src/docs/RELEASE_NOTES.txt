CalDAV4j 0.2
Release Notes
        
COMPLETENESS
============

An important question when evalutating any protocol library is "How completely 
does this library implement the spec?" The answer in this case right now is: 
"Not Very." Supporting the Scooby project was the prime driver of development 
for this release and hence just those parts of the spec that were needed for Scooby 
to talk to Cosmo were implemented (CalDAV4j does aim to be a full featured 
library though.)

Another tricky aspect of implementing a CalDAV library is that the CalDAV spec 
is not finalized, and plenty of things have changed since starting coding for 
this release - when we started CalDAV was on revision 8, and now it is at 
revision 10. Hence this implementation is somewhere in the middle.

Yet, even after all these caveats, CalDAV4j can still be useful for many 
applications.

Here is a (rough) guide to where things are at right now:

METHODS
=======
GET - No known issues

PUT - No known issues

REPORT - Right now only <calender-query> reports are fully supported. That
means no free-busy reports!

MKCALENDAR - No known issues

HIGH LEVEL API
==============
CalDAVCalendarCollection is the high level API for accessing CalDAV calendar 
collections. Right now only VEVENTs are supported, and it is likely that this
API will change drastically in upcoming releases.

NEW FEATURES
============

* The big thing that's new is caching. You can supply a CalDAVCalendarCollection 
with a CalDAVResourceCache which will cache CalDAVResources. The 
CalDAVCalendarCollection will still need to use connect to the CalDAV server to
get the latest etag and make sure that it matches the etag of the cached 
resource. There is also a cache for uid's to hrefs, so that getting VEVENTS by
UID requires one less request.
