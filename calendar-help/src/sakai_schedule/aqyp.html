<h2>Changing your calendar's view</h2>
<p>In Schedule, you can view your
calendar by day, week, month, or year. To change your view, use the
"View" drop-down list to select <strong><code>Calendar by Day</code></strong>, <strong><code>Calendar
by Week</code></strong>, <strong><code>Calendar by Month</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Calendar by
Year</code></strong>. To view all of your scheduled activities in a list, click
<strong><code>List of Events</code></strong>.</p>

<p>When viewed by day or week, the calendar will display a time range
of 10 hours. To adjust the range so that it displays hours that are
earlier or later in the day, click the links at the top (earlier) or
bottom (later) of the calendar.</p>

<p>When viewing your activities in list form (by clicking <strong><code>List of
Events</code></strong>), you can change which activities are displayed using the
"Show" drop-down list. Choose either <strong><code>All activities
(default)</code></strong>, <strong><code>Activities for today</code></strong>, <strong><code>Activities for this
week</code></strong>, <strong><code>Activities for this month</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Activities for
this year</code></strong>. Additionally, to set a custom date range, select
<strong><code>Custom date range</code></strong>, use the "Start" and "End" fields to set
