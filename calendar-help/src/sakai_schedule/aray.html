<h2>Schedule: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3> 

<p>Schedule allows instructors or
site organizers to post items in a calendar format. The calendar has
day, week, month, year, and flat list views.</p>

<p>Many instructors use Schedule to post readings for each class on
the day they are due to be read.</p>

<p>Research, group, and department projects often use Schedule to post group deadlines.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Activity list:</strong> To see a list of all the activities on
a calendar, next to "View", click <strong><code>List of Events</code></strong>.</p>

<p> <strong>Merging calendars:</strong>
All calendars on sites you have access to are merged in your My
Workspace Schedule. You can also selectively merge
calendars from sites you have access to using the Merge feature from
the site you want to add other calendars to.</p>



<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Any Schedule item can have multiple attachments.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can print an Adobe PDF file of any view of a
Schedule by clicking
<strong><code>Printable Version</code></strong> while in the desired view. This will open a
PDF file in a new browser window.
